00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:04,639
hey there today we're going to be
learning about github and we're also

2
00:00:04,639 --> 00:00:07,759
going to be learning about source
control if you guys I'm pretty sure

3
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:10,759
you're sitting in one of probably three
boats right now

4
00:00:10,759 --> 00:00:14,719
one you have no idea what get hub is no
one's talked about it you've not heard

5
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:19,190
about it and i'm here to talk about it
because it's really important and pretty

6
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:23,150
much any professional company is going
to be using github or something like it

7
00:00:23,149 --> 00:00:28,759
and will expect you to know it or you're
sitting in a boat number two you've

8
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:31,789
heard about it you know about it but you
haven't learned to get its kind of been

9
00:00:31,789 --> 00:00:36,770
a black box we're going to make that an
easy thing to learn today and step three

10
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:42,079
you person number three you've may be
used sub subversion or CVS you know what

11
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:44,689
source control is you just want to learn
get hub

12
00:00:44,689 --> 00:00:49,549
this might not be the tutorial for you
because i'll be getting a little bit

13
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:53,328
more ground level stuff here but you
learn it all

14
00:00:53,329 --> 00:00:56,600
it just might be a little bit slower
paced for you so let's get into real

15
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,520
quick what is source control

16
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:01,730
why is it important why is every
employer value it

17
00:01:01,729 --> 00:01:05,868
let's say there's two people right here
pretend my screen is divided here and

18
00:01:05,868 --> 00:01:10,998
these are two guys up here we have John
and down here we have Bobby

19
00:01:10,998 --> 00:01:16,548
so let's say this is the exact same file
open on John's computer open on Bobby's

20
00:01:16,549 --> 00:01:21,499
computer and John edits this thing and
he has an item in here he adds an li and

21
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:24,679
he adds sand

22
00:01:24,679 --> 00:01:30,019
now how does Bobby get that change if
Bobby's already made five changes he's

23
00:01:30,019 --> 00:01:34,519
added his own stuff down here now you've
got to get together and getting a room

24
00:01:34,519 --> 00:01:39,138
you've got to open up both copies of the
file it gets messy as you can imagine in

25
00:01:39,138 --> 00:01:42,798
a company of 10 people it gets messy
almost instantly

26
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:48,770
what do you do another common prop
problem is people overriding people

27
00:01:48,769 --> 00:01:52,248
stuff the leading people stuff having to
check out files

28
00:01:52,248 --> 00:01:56,179
there's really no clean way to do it
people have to be able to work on the

29
00:01:56,179 --> 00:02:01,399
same files at the same time without
hours and hours of wasted work and

30
00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:05,060
unnecessary communication that's where
source control came in

31
00:02:05,778 --> 00:02:12,019
what git hub will do or get will do for
you is you open a get project and that

32
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:13,430
keeps track of all the change

33
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:18,349
is that you make so when I make this
change it knows that I've made this

34
00:02:18,348 --> 00:02:23,089
change and then i can at any time
connect and find out anyone elses

35
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:24,259
changes

36
00:02:24,259 --> 00:02:28,489
so let's say Bobby's added I forget what
it is rope

37
00:02:28,489 --> 00:02:32,150
I don't know why use rope if you're
hitting a brick wall at any time I can

38
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:36,769
sync up to the repository and it will
pull in the fact that Bobby made and

39
00:02:36,769 --> 00:02:40,938
saved this change and so then I won't
lose any work

40
00:02:40,938 --> 00:02:45,680
it'll just automatically boom boom boom
throw in everyone else's changes and at

41
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,669
the same time he can do the same thing
he can sync up to the repository and get

42
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:54,169
my changes every once in a while you get
what's called a merge conflict and

43
00:02:54,169 --> 00:02:57,290
that's when both i have edited this line

44
00:02:57,289 --> 00:03:04,098
i'm going to call it a good mortar and
he's going to call this mortar and if he

45
00:03:04,098 --> 00:03:06,768
saves that and then I sync up to the
repository

46
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:10,968
it's not going to know who's right it's
just going to know i changed it and

47
00:03:10,968 --> 00:03:14,989
Bobby change it so I'll get something
like this depending on what kind of

48
00:03:14,989 --> 00:03:28,098
source control i'm using I'll get your
version something that looks and output

49
00:03:28,098 --> 00:03:35,539
like this and it will say it's a
conflict and also have to go okay

50
00:03:35,539 --> 00:03:38,810
hmm one of these is the right one which
one is the right one

51
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:42,169
Bobby change this I change this

52
00:03:42,169 --> 00:03:45,290
oh I know what i'll do i'll go more good
mortar

53
00:03:45,289 --> 00:03:50,269
there we go and then I'll get rid of all
this junk and I'll save my file and now

54
00:03:50,269 --> 00:03:55,639
I had to manually merge changes that
will still happen sometimes but get hub

55
00:03:55,639 --> 00:03:57,500
will flag for you

56
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:01,519
everything that both people have done
the way to minimize having to do that

57
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:04,579
because that is kind of a pain in the
rear and there's really no way around it

58
00:04:04,579 --> 00:04:08,719
is to make sure you have good
communication on generally who's working

59
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:13,280
on what tasks and that shouldn't happen
very often and when it does it shouldn't

60
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,009
be much bigger than what I just kind of
showed you right there

61
00:04:16,009 --> 00:04:20,000
so let's get into get hub let's get into
an actual project and how we're going to

62
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,399
set this up and manage this first thing
you'll need to do is you need to get

63
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:26,709
github installed on your

64
00:04:26,709 --> 00:04:30,068
Peter and you'll need to sign up for
github account so go to github com and

65
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:36,039
sign up for an account its free and then
also go to Mac github com or windows .

66
00:04:36,038 --> 00:04:40,418
github com and install the github
application that will take care of

67
00:04:40,418 --> 00:04:44,740
everything else you need for your right
there and it will give you a visual

68
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:49,269
application which i will tell you not to
use

69
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:52,989
so this is the visual application it
will give you

70
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:58,060
it's super easy really easy to get
started but a lot of employers look down

71
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:03,728
on it because lots of people use this is
a crutch instead of actually learning

72
00:05:03,728 --> 00:05:09,728
the command line the command line is not
hard it's about five commands a lot of

73
00:05:09,728 --> 00:05:13,449
people just avoid it like the plague is
seeing a black screen freaks them out

74
00:05:13,449 --> 00:05:17,259
but we're going to get past that fear
today and have a great time with it so

75
00:05:17,259 --> 00:05:22,840
i'm going to go ahead now and create a
new repository think of repository

76
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:30,519
equals project whatever I already did
one called get tutorial as a test so new

77
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:36,008
gets test so i'm making a repository
called new get tests and the only thing

78
00:05:36,009 --> 00:05:41,110
I'm going to check here is initialized
this repository with the readme and that

79
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:42,968
allows me to clone it right away

80
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:46,389
I'll show you what that means so you see
it made a new repository for me called

81
00:05:46,389 --> 00:05:47,500
nougat test

82
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:51,250
I already have my first file which is
called read me and all the readme has is

83
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:55,089
this what the readme is its kind of any
instructions

84
00:05:55,089 --> 00:05:58,448
you're going to give to people who use
this repository it's automatically

85
00:05:58,449 --> 00:06:04,960
displayed when you open up the
repository so I'm going to do here is

86
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:08,019
I'm going to copy this clone URL

87
00:06:08,019 --> 00:06:11,348
this is what I will use to get it on my
machine ok that's all i need to do

88
00:06:11,348 --> 00:06:12,459
forget hub

89
00:06:12,459 --> 00:06:16,388
so now i'm going to use yes the dreaded
command line

90
00:06:16,389 --> 00:06:20,319
lots of you guys have been avoiding this
because you're terrified of it you don't

91
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:25,120
know what to do with it and we're going
to get into this today so if you're on

92
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:30,129
Mac you only need to know like three
commands to actually use this thing and

93
00:06:30,129 --> 00:06:35,228
then get hubs five commands and if
you're on Windows same thing to open it

94
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:37,120
with Mac you go to utilities

95
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,910
applications utilities terminal

96
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:43,380
and then to open it on windows you're
going to go run and type CMD and hit

97
00:06:43,379 --> 00:06:44,279
enter

98
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:53,429
so basically CD is your change directory
command so if i go CD . i'm going to go

99
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:54,420
up a directory

100
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:57,870
I just went from documents into will so
now i can go CD back into documents

101
00:06:58,529 --> 00:07:08,309
there we go i can also go see . nauman
users i can go CD will documents and I

102
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:12,209
that's basically CD that's your first
command and the other one is going to LS

103
00:07:12,209 --> 00:07:16,439
and that will show you a listing of all
the files in your directory if you're on

104
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:22,589
Windows it's going to be dir unless you
have fake linux mac commands installed

105
00:07:22,589 --> 00:07:28,169
so you can see I have a few files in my
documents thing not much what I'm going

106
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:32,370
to do is I want to put the repository
and documents so I'm going to go get

107
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:37,649
clone and i'm going to paste that URL
that i copied clone is your first get

108
00:07:37,649 --> 00:07:38,519
command

109
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:42,509
well that does is it takes that
repository and it copies the whole thing

110
00:07:42,509 --> 00:07:47,430
down and puts it in a folder called its
name by its name so now if i hit LS you

111
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:53,730
can see that i have a folder called new
get tests OCD new get tests and LS

112
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:57,870
I've got read me . md that's my only
file

113
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:01,139
okay that's about all i'm going to do
for now let me go ahead and add that

114
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:06,990
folder to my project here and New get
test

115
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:11,250
there we go so now I've got my folder
and I can do away with you

116
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:15,480
you're not necessary anymore actually
what you're saying and what I'm going to

117
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:19,080
do down here is let's say John Bob does
the same thing he's going to go get

118
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:24,479
clone not read me md this URL

119
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:30,180
jon is also working on our project so he
also is going to clone it you notice

120
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:34,620
I've cloned into a different folder so
you can actually have the same folder on

121
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:40,560
your computer in 20 different places and
this one's in my github folder here we

122
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:41,098
go

123
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:46,200
so now we both have the repository here
and i'm going to go ahead over here on

124
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:51,040
the top and I'm going to make a new file
I'm going to save it as

125
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:58,719
as you get tests will call index dot
HTML and let's make something here real

126
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,720
quick

127
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:10,540
let's make our first I list here we'll
just kind of recreate what we had bricks

128
00:09:10,539 --> 00:09:17,828
bricks and mortar let's just make it a
list of two items i'll save it and you

129
00:09:17,828 --> 00:09:23,500
notice i got index 2.html there and John
still doesn't have anything because he's

130
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:26,379
not he's just working on his own

131
00:09:26,379 --> 00:09:31,600
let me go ahead and I'll make a new file
here for John and we'll call it

132
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:39,250
index 2.html

133
00:09:43,929 --> 00:09:51,039
well just make it will just do this you
l must leave it like that

134
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:55,299
so John's got index - I've got index and
we're both working on the project and

135
00:09:55,299 --> 00:09:57,068
that's all the progress we've made

136
00:09:57,068 --> 00:10:01,120
so here are you ready here's we've got
our first command which is get clone

137
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,568
that's going to pull her any repository
in using its URL

138
00:10:04,568 --> 00:10:10,149
our next get command is get status so
this is going to show us what's

139
00:10:10,149 --> 00:10:15,278
different between us and get hub up in
the sky right now so all that's

140
00:10:15,278 --> 00:10:18,759
different now is there's an untracked
file we have created file called

141
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:22,750
index.html get up has no clue that this
file exists

142
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:27,399
so I'm going to do right now is I'm
going to do get ad which means we're

143
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:33,458
going to add any changes or any new
files or whatever by name so add index

144
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:34,989
dot HTML

145
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:40,000
so now we've said Kate put this guy into
our project if I do get status again

146
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,220
you'll notice that it's now a change to
be committed we have a new file index

147
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:46,360
dot HTML

148
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:50,889
so now all i have to do is I've added it
I can go get to commit

149
00:10:50,889 --> 00:10:58,120
which means I'm locking it in to the
repository get commit at dash M means

150
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:01,839
i'm giving it a message and the message
is going to be in quotes

151
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:02,529
add it

152
00:11:02,528 --> 00:11:08,948
index dot HTML there we go so now it's
committed but it's still on my machine

153
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:14,889
it's locked into the repository but it's
not synced up to get hub . com yet so

154
00:11:14,889 --> 00:11:18,549
all we have to do to get it to do a sink
is get push

155
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:24,039
that's going to take anything on our
machine and push it up to get hub . com

156
00:11:24,039 --> 00:11:29,438
so now if i go to github com and i
refresh you'll notice i have index dot

157
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:30,399
HTML

158
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:34,240
so there we go now it's up there I'm
going to hide this

159
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:42,159
and so now if this guy here goes get
pull which is so push pushes up to

160
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:46,990
github com and pull is going to pull
down from github com whoops I'm not the

161
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:54,730
right directory CD space new get test
get pull these commands will only work

162
00:11:54,730 --> 00:12:00,610
when you're in the directory of your
github repository because you can have a

163
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:04,990
hundred different repositories on your
computer so i didn't get pole and you

164
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:07,839
see it pulled in index dot HTML

165
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:13,059
now I've got them both so now John's
going to do is john scott this guy and

166
00:12:13,058 --> 00:12:16,058
i'm also going to add an item to my list
here

167
00:12:16,688 --> 00:12:22,000
sand so now if I do get status

168
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:28,929
I see two things i've modified index dot
HTML and I have an untracked file myself

169
00:12:28,929 --> 00:12:37,989
so I can you get ad index dot HTML and
you'll see that now if I do get status

170
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:43,899
the changes for commit our that i've
modified this guy up sorry wrong one

171
00:12:43,899 --> 00:12:47,649
changes to be committed that modified
this and i still have an untracked file

172
00:12:47,649 --> 00:12:49,808
that's not ready to be committed

173
00:12:49,808 --> 00:12:57,278
so I can do get ad index to another
thing you can do is you can you get ad .

174
00:12:57,278 --> 00:13:02,558
which is going to do everything in your
directory or you can you get hat add -

175
00:13:02,558 --> 00:13:09,969
capital A which is going to do get at
all so I'm going to get add a an alpha

176
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:13,209
to get status you see that I've got two
files ready to go

177
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:15,500
one its modified one that's brand new

178
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:21,590
and i'm going to do a terribly generic
git commit which is a bad idea made

179
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:22,610
changes

180
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:27,560
that's not useful to anyone but oh well
so I've added committed

181
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:36,230
I'm going to push and now over here i'm
going to pull gets pull

182
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:40,009
but before I yes I get full there we go

183
00:13:40,009 --> 00:13:46,309
and so now notice I've got index - and
my index one automatically has all the

184
00:13:46,309 --> 00:13:50,239
updated changes if five different people
were working on these files and i did a

185
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,240
poll it get everybody's changes as long
as they push them up

186
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:57,769
so that's kind of how it works you'll
notice the commands are too bad so far

187
00:13:57,769 --> 00:14:04,250
we've got get status get ad get commit
get pushed it pole

188
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:08,210
Matt's kind of your basics in to get hub

189
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:12,920
there's about ten commands in total if i
just type get it will show me kind of

190
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:20,539
all the commands that i can use and kind
of what they do and that's pretty much

191
00:14:20,539 --> 00:14:24,319
the beginning of github so let's talk
about a little bit about workflow

192
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:28,129
how do you actually do this so one thing
I'll do is when i come in at the

193
00:14:28,129 --> 00:14:29,389
beginning of each day

194
00:14:29,389 --> 00:14:33,259
i'm going to start off by doing a get
pull want to make sure I get everybody's

195
00:14:33,259 --> 00:14:35,600
updates from all you know

196
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,930
last night the rest of the day hey
already up today great

197
00:14:38,929 --> 00:14:43,009
I'm going to make my changes . that ah
this isn't water anymore

198
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:50,269
it's now called I don't know something
else quikrete think that's how you spell

199
00:14:50,269 --> 00:14:54,079
it made that change death at a

200
00:14:54,080 --> 00:15:05,180
and so now I'm ready to push my changes
up i'm going to add everything made more

201
00:15:05,179 --> 00:15:08,179
more specific

202
00:15:08,809 --> 00:15:13,519
got it got all my changes done I'm ready
to sync up all my work to the repository

203
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:19,009
I'll do this with every kind of
incremental piece of work I do i will

204
00:15:19,009 --> 00:15:25,250
probably add commits all throughout the
day and then every few hours in the day

205
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:29,210
I'm going to make sure i'm in sync to
make sure I don't get away far office

206
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:30,050
stuff

207
00:15:30,049 --> 00:15:34,399
let's create what's called a merge
conflict here instead of mortar i'm

208
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:38,240
going to put i'm going to change this to
more mortar

209
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:45,620
I think we already went through that
example so get at a git commit

210
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:56,360
let's say down here on the bottom what's
this guy's name again Bobby Bobby just

211
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:02,659
made a change on a line that i made a
change on and so now when I do a git

212
00:16:02,659 --> 00:16:03,649
pull

213
00:16:03,649 --> 00:16:09,470
I says conflict merge conflict in index
dot HTML

214
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:14,300
you have to fix the conflicts and then
commit the result

215
00:16:14,299 --> 00:16:17,719
basically you've both changed these
lines and that look first this looks

216
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:21,080
like crazy freaking out what the heck do
I do with this

217
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:24,290
all it's telling me is his head which is
what I'm on

218
00:16:24,289 --> 00:16:29,389
we made this change to this line and
somebody else made this change

219
00:16:30,139 --> 00:16:34,279
so what do we do about it I'm not smart
enough to know you've got to figure this

220
00:16:34,279 --> 00:16:34,850
out

221
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:38,149
it's not too bad i just look at the two
lines and say okay

222
00:16:38,149 --> 00:16:41,059
he was adding more which is our
company's way of saying we need to get

223
00:16:41,059 --> 00:16:45,169
more than one so I'm just going to do
more quikrete i'm going to kind of

224
00:16:45,169 --> 00:16:50,269
manually merge those lines together or
I'm going to just say no quick crees all

225
00:16:50,269 --> 00:16:51,439
right line

226
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,830
he didn't really know what he's talking
about we don't ever say more anyway i

227
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:59,960
manually make the decision i delete all
the helper things that it gave me save

228
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:04,850
my file and now i just hit get commit
with nothing in there

229
00:17:06,048 --> 00:17:12,709
let's get add a git commit forgot to add
it

230
00:17:13,368 --> 00:17:18,828
you notice it said ok now its continuing
my merge branch of Master and by the way

231
00:17:18,828 --> 00:17:22,519
if you ever accidentally hit commit
without a message or anything you'll get

232
00:17:22,519 --> 00:17:25,099
this screen you won't figure out how to
get out of it

233
00:17:25,099 --> 00:17:33,528
you hit escape : WQ to save it escaped :
WQ

234
00:17:33,528 --> 00:17:39,829
there you go merge branch master yes
escape : WQ is the most complicated part

235
00:17:39,829 --> 00:17:41,808
of everything we're going to learn today

236
00:17:41,808 --> 00:17:45,230
just write that one down it takes a long
time and I'm always forgetting it

237
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:50,028
escaped : WQ is how you get out of a
full-blown commit

238
00:17:50,028 --> 00:17:55,099
I'll show you real quick just what that
was so let's say I made a change

239
00:17:55,849 --> 00:18:01,819
now I can modify the index get add a
it's commits if you ever just hit commit

240
00:18:01,819 --> 00:18:03,499
without the dash M

241
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:07,909
it's going to open up this same thing
it's for a full-blown message is what it

242
00:18:07,909 --> 00:18:10,909
is it's for a multiline message

243
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:24,039
there you go so that's kind of what that
was it was like a multi-line commit

244
00:18:24,039 --> 00:18:25,779
message once again escaped

245
00:18:25,779 --> 00:18:39,250
: WQ enter and there you go get push and
now he can do it get pole you can 5 out

246
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:41,319
and find out that i've deleted that line

247
00:18:41,319 --> 00:18:47,619
there you go and that is your intro to
get hub once again get commit get add a

248
00:18:47,619 --> 00:18:50,589
get pushed it pull

249
00:18:50,589 --> 00:18:52,419
that's about it have a great day
