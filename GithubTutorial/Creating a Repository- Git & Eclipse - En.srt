00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:06,258
hello I'm dr. Brian Frazer and in this
tutorial I'm going to show how to use

2
00:00:06,259 --> 00:00:11,120
git within eclipse to create a
repository and push that repository

3
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:16,039
we're going to start by working with a
local repository and then moved working

4
00:00:16,039 --> 00:00:17,868
with get up

5
00:00:17,868 --> 00:00:21,050
so to begin with i have created a basic
java project

6
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:23,719
this doesn't have to be a job a project
that could be any project you like

7
00:00:23,719 --> 00:00:27,469
android see whatever and inside of this

8
00:00:27,469 --> 00:00:31,248
I've got the files that I you know might
be starting with I've initially got here

9
00:00:31,248 --> 00:00:33,558
a main file that's a class

10
00:00:33,558 --> 00:00:38,808
all it does is it instantiates sales
data object calls them sink a simple

11
00:00:38,808 --> 00:00:43,968
method down here and then calls data .
display which calls into this function

12
00:00:43,969 --> 00:00:46,340
here in my data object

13
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:50,090
oh it does at the moment is Prince a
message to the screen through the

14
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:53,750
tutorials later on we're going to be
editing these files and seeing how they

15
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:59,480
change but for the moment it for the
time being if i run this we can see down

16
00:00:59,479 --> 00:01:05,658
here is simply print out the two
messages from this file and then execute

17
00:01:05,659 --> 00:01:08,420
sale data and Prince of that message

18
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:12,859
nothing special ok so now what happens
if other people want to work on this

19
00:01:13,578 --> 00:01:18,469
well I need to start sharing this i need
to start working with get other tools

20
00:01:18,469 --> 00:01:20,868
such as svn or CSV would also work

21
00:01:20,868 --> 00:01:23,989
this is also about get so let's see what
happens so I'm first going to right

22
00:01:23,989 --> 00:01:30,199
click on the project and then go down to
team and then share project team share

23
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,109
project here

24
00:01:33,109 --> 00:01:38,478
I then have the gip provider and then i
select what do I want to do with it well

25
00:01:38,478 --> 00:01:42,019
I've got to first create a local
repository to work with

26
00:01:42,019 --> 00:01:47,750
i'm going to create the default path is
probably fine for accessing that and i'm

27
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:49,590
going to give it a name so let's call
this

28
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:55,920
sales tool repository and just for fun
i'm going to call it local sales to a

29
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,879
repository

30
00:01:56,879 --> 00:01:59,459
just so we know what we're working on
you probably don't need the word local

31
00:01:59,459 --> 00:02:00,839
in yours

32
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,859
I'm not going to bother providing a path
in the repository that's fine i'll just

33
00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:08,909
say finish because this whole project is
going to be the report the repository

34
00:02:08,909 --> 00:02:12,329
now what just happened hmm

35
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:15,450
we don't really see any changes going on

36
00:02:15,449 --> 00:02:18,659
so what I want to do is I want to bring
up some extra views i'm going to go to

37
00:02:18,659 --> 00:02:26,340
window show views and then go to other
under well first off I'm going to going

38
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:32,549
to get so if you want to get I want to
look at the repositories and the staging

39
00:02:32,549 --> 00:02:37,980
area is actually going to be handy later
so you bring that up and the one other

40
00:02:37,979 --> 00:02:45,389
one I want is the perspective the
history center team select history

41
00:02:45,389 --> 00:02:49,738
let's start by looking here under my
repositories

42
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:56,159
what have I done well I created my local
sales repository 20 repository and now

43
00:02:56,159 --> 00:02:59,729
i'm working with that we can see here
that I've got branches

44
00:03:00,509 --> 00:03:06,060
well I got nothing really going on here
at the moment and I've got no remotes

45
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,579
the references is not much of anything

46
00:03:08,579 --> 00:03:12,900
so what I need to do is we need to do my
very first commit to go back into my

47
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:16,709
file here now i happen to have already
up here my toolbar

48
00:03:16,709 --> 00:03:21,479
i'm gonna show you how to get this get
toolbar you go to windows and then

49
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:24,479
customize perspective

50
00:03:26,229 --> 00:03:30,488
we're not yet showing the get ability so
you have to come under command group

51
00:03:30,489 --> 00:03:38,049
availability and then put a checkmark
and get click ok and that's not going to

52
00:03:38,049 --> 00:03:42,129
give you the get when you hear that you
can work with plus the toolbar here at

53
00:03:42,128 --> 00:03:46,359
the top that I liked so I got my files
all ready to go

54
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:53,980
all ready to be checked into my
repository helps i'm showing something

55
00:03:53,979 --> 00:03:59,289
here I just tried saving the file but it
tells me here that doesn't follow longer

56
00:03:59,289 --> 00:04:00,219
exists

57
00:04:00,219 --> 00:04:02,859
it's actually been moved I had these
files open to begin with so I'm gonna

58
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:06,700
have to close them here and now when I
open them again

59
00:04:07,329 --> 00:04:10,060
it's gonna be in a different place if I
right click on this and go to properties

60
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:16,930
we can see here that it's now moved to
under my get sub folder so it's actually

61
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:18,370
moved my project

62
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:25,000
that's ok so i'll move those up

63
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,720
save those and now what I want to do is
I want to commit so i could go here

64
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,039
right click go to team and then I could
go to commit

65
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:37,870
I'll try that to begin with I give her a
message

66
00:04:38,589 --> 00:04:48,098
initial check in sales tool provided
author so forth

67
00:04:48,098 --> 00:04:51,639
this email address of using get help may
be publicly available so you might want

68
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:53,348
to use one that you don't really care
about

69
00:04:53,348 --> 00:04:57,279
so these are the files that i can choose
to check in

70
00:04:57,279 --> 00:05:00,848
I like this button here on the right add
them all except I don't really want to

71
00:05:00,848 --> 00:05:03,399
add them all i want to add most of them
so i'm going to go through and remove

72
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:04,329
those I don't

73
00:05:04,329 --> 00:05:08,379
there's no sense in checking in my
compiled class files they just be a pain

74
00:05:08,379 --> 00:05:10,029
to manage merges on later

75
00:05:10,029 --> 00:05:13,179
so I'm going to keep those out of my
repository so to begin with I'm just

76
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:16,209
going to say don't check in the class
files but checking everything else

77
00:05:16,209 --> 00:05:19,989
so I've got my project files the
classpath project and some settings

78
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:23,949
plus I've got all my source files you
might also have resources like text

79
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:29,080
files HTML files documents or even
images

80
00:05:29,949 --> 00:05:36,039
I guess they commit now what's happened
is you notice down here under my local

81
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:42,490
repository under branches local I have
this thing called master master is the

82
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:44,110
main line that we're building on

83
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:47,110
so master is now created

84
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:49,600
now the next thing i want to do is I
want to be able to say well let's push

85
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:55,180
this up if i go to my web page gain hit
f3

86
00:05:55,810 --> 00:06:00,220
sorry i haven't been there yet i have
not yet created anything online

87
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:04,090
so nothing is yet gone on to my get hub
repository

88
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:12,009
so if i go into history here if I right
click on my project and i think there's

89
00:06:12,009 --> 00:06:13,899
a show in button

90
00:06:13,899 --> 00:06:18,519
maybe just off the screen we bring this
up we've it all right click on that

91
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:24,730
try to gain right click show in history
and now we've got here on the right-hand

92
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:27,250
side all the history of my project

93
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:30,279
this is going to be critical we're going
to really want to look at this a lot

94
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:35,469
later on but let's start off by going up
to the remote server so i want to go

95
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:38,500
into here and i want to say i want to
create a remote

96
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:42,759
now how am I going to do that

97
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:45,909
well I need to first going to get help
so you bring my browser

98
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:49,780
I'm going to get hub com i've already
logged in with the user ID they're free

99
00:06:49,779 --> 00:06:53,739
to create and i'm going to create a new
repository so use this button down here

100
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:58,689
new repository we can pick a name for it

101
00:06:58,689 --> 00:07:01,689
let's call the sales tool

102
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:06,620
I can provide a description i want i'm
going to make it public so it's free and

103
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:10,069
then create a repository so you can see
here and I've create a repository

104
00:07:10,069 --> 00:07:11,990
there's nothing in it

105
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:16,579
what I really want is I want this URL
i'm going to copy this this is the way

106
00:07:16,579 --> 00:07:21,889
that I'm going to get access into my
github repository from within eclipse

107
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:27,740
so I'm going to get back into eclipse
creating a remote reference repository

108
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:30,050
to connect to your name and origin

109
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:35,240
that's the standard name of what we do
talk about the upstream repository so

110
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,410
we'll leave with origin

111
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:43,580
i'm going to change the URL here so it
brings in whatever I had copied already

112
00:07:43,579 --> 00:07:47,419
it fills in the host and the extra
pieces of information from that I need

113
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:55,939
to put in my user ID and my password you
can choose to save this is secure

114
00:07:55,939 --> 00:07:59,420
storage just don't have to type it in
every time

115
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:03,140
so a quick finish now we've got this
safe here now

116
00:08:03,139 --> 00:08:06,289
this ref mapping is actually quite
interesting

117
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:11,240
I'm going to want to add one here so I
could go through ad type it in that's a

118
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:14,660
little more , up harder than I want i'm
going to go through the advanced because

119
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:18,770
it happens to fill in everything for me
so I say what source drifter I want it

120
00:08:18,769 --> 00:08:23,299
to be ye what do I want to work on out
and work on this master this master

121
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:27,199
branch is really the one I'm going to be
pushing so it's like master here

122
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:32,149
destination it automatically fills in
the master there and add spec that's

123
00:08:32,149 --> 00:08:38,870
really the only thing i want to push up
to my repository is a specification in

124
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:39,979
the origin configuration

125
00:08:39,979 --> 00:08:44,540
sounds good click finish and i'm going
to save here i could say save and push

126
00:08:44,539 --> 00:08:47,329
but let's do it in two steps going to
first save

127
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:51,290
expand remote here we see we have the
origin which is good that the one I

128
00:08:51,289 --> 00:08:55,519
really want to work with and then i can
for example push to get over this one

129
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,259
with the red arrow put pointing to it

130
00:08:57,259 --> 00:09:00,259
I could right click and say push let's
try that

131
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:08,330
push the road push so it's done this
pushed to local sales -

132
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:11,780
origin so it pushed to the local the
origin rather of it click OK

133
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:17,930
i'm going to switch back to my web
browser hit f5 to reload and we'll see

134
00:09:17,929 --> 00:09:20,299
that we've actually push something up to
the server

135
00:09:20,299 --> 00:09:25,069
so Brian Frazer four minutes ago push
sales tools

136
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:32,480
so go into this i can see all the files
that i just checked in my source CA and

137
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,080
here's my main file just like we had
down on my program

138
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:41,690
ok so now I've done that now as a few
things are going to want to do let's

139
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:44,720
just make another change and walk you
that once more this isn't how r normal

140
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,379
going to make changes we'll see how
later on to do that but let's just put

141
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:51,649
something in here

142
00:09:51,649 --> 00:09:58,879
test 1 i'm going to run it to make sure
it works

143
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:02,629
well we got an error so cancel that what
do we got well print

144
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:09,679
LOL and we want you to run that with
ctrl f11 we can see here it actually ran

145
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:12,739
it's fantastic now i want to check this
in

146
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:22,759
so i can use up here I can check in now
i'm going to say first change like

147
00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:24,909
normally had something more description
so a

148
00:10:24,909 --> 00:10:27,909
add a simple output change

149
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:35,289
I could say commit and push but I'm
going to work on just two steps and

150
00:10:35,289 --> 00:10:42,429
stages hearing as they commit it now
pushes it up to my local repository so

151
00:10:42,429 --> 00:10:46,329
we can see here that the latest thing
pushed up with that and I don't yet have

152
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:48,129
it on

153
00:10:48,129 --> 00:10:53,740
I open up references this is the yeah
that's references there so the remote

154
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:58,120
doesn't yet have a so i can say i can
right click on this and give us a push

155
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:04,090
branch so there's only one good one

156
00:11:08,509 --> 00:11:12,379
and it pushes it up here we can see the
different changes being pushed

157
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:21,710
that's now gone up so let's check it I
go ahead of five this file reload so we

158
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:24,680
can see here that indeed my change
actually made it to the server

159
00:11:24,679 --> 00:11:30,109
so that's a very simple change after
having checking the project now we

160
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:34,580
notice that it kept asking for you want
what files you want to submit and here

161
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:41,000
we see on my project Explorer that
there's not listing those extra bin

162
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,259
files that we had

163
00:11:42,259 --> 00:11:45,559
i'm going to switch to my navigator tab
if you don't have this you can go to

164
00:11:45,559 --> 00:11:52,489
window show view go to other and then
say now

165
00:11:53,029 --> 00:11:58,370
navigator it's like that and we'll come
up with a navigator shows me the actual

166
00:11:58,370 --> 00:11:59,810
files that are present

167
00:11:59,809 --> 00:12:03,019
let's get this bin folder with a
question mark meaning that it doesn't

168
00:12:03,019 --> 00:12:06,740
actually know it's not being checked in
to get going to right click on my whole

169
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:09,409
bin folder I'm going to team

170
00:12:09,409 --> 00:12:17,000
I'm gonna say ignore so now it's going
to ignore that file

171
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,340
note that it actually created get . get
ignore and it simply lists all the files

172
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:23,509
that are going to be ignored

173
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:26,509
so you can add in here you got any other
generated files you want to ignore

174
00:12:27,019 --> 00:12:30,889
now this is a file like any other let's
go ahead and commit that to the

175
00:12:30,889 --> 00:12:34,460
repository so I'm going to

176
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:43,509
go up here and i'm going to say commit
added ignore

177
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:56,269
with that in and I'm going to push now I
can just go here push changes upstream

178
00:12:56,269 --> 00:12:59,000
it says upstream it kind of knows that
it always defaults are going to the

179
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,600
origin

180
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,589
it knows the upstream location and so
now it's going to push that up to the

181
00:13:03,589 --> 00:13:07,339
appropriate repository online and the
next time we go to check in

182
00:13:07,339 --> 00:13:10,519
it's not going to ask hey you want to
check in those files you asked to ignore

183
00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:15,528
you want to set it up the ignore
carefully because then all of your team

184
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:19,189
members will also get the same ignore
file that's handy because then nobody

185
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:25,880
else inadvertently checks in for example
a half- generated exe files

186
00:13:25,879 --> 00:13:34,009
ok so what we see what we have so how to
using the tool or team and then the

187
00:13:34,009 --> 00:13:39,528
share project we saw how to share it
with a local repository so in here and

188
00:13:39,528 --> 00:13:41,778
we saw how to push that up to the
remotes

189
00:13:41,778 --> 00:13:45,679
now as it turns out we see here that
it's actually tracking the loading

190
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:48,769
if you want more information check the
comments below it will give you a link

191
00:13:48,769 --> 00:13:50,810
